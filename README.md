# Sentimental_analysis
Tracking Sentimental analysis of tweets and reply with relevant memes

We use the polarity measure to track the sentiments of the tweet
i.e :- 

if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
				senti = 1
			elif(analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0):
				senti = 0
			else:
				senti = -1

this is a way of automatically tracking the mood or sentiment of the tweet and bot generating the memes to brighten up the day.

in this file  there are four documents

two images in examples and two files in python where we have used the algorithm to track the sentiments.


happy open sourcing folks :)
